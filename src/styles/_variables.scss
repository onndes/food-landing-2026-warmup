/**
 * COLOR VARIABLES NOTE
 *
 * This project is not a production product.
 * It is a personal practice project aimed at restoring muscle memory
 * and getting back into web development after a long break.
 *
 * The original Figma file contains a large number of similar color shades
 * without a clear color system or semantic naming.
 *
 * For this reason, color variables are intentionally kept in a simplified
 * and sometimes non-semantic form. Time-consuming color normalization
 * and precise palette tuning are out of scope for this project and are
 * not part of the learning goals.
 *
 * The focus here is on layout, structure, CSS architecture, and component
 * implementation rather than design system accuracy.
